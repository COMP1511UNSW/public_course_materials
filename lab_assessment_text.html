To obtain a mark for a lab exercise you should (as a pair) demonstrate the completed lab exercise
to your tutor during a lab class and both members of the pair should separately submit it using give.
<p>
You should normally get your lab work assessed <em>during</em> the
week for which it is scheduled (i.e. you must complete the week 3
lab exercise during the week 3 lab).
If you don't finish it during the lab, you may continue working on
it during the week, but you both <b>must</b> submit it (using <code>give</code>)
by the following Monday 11:00am  in order to get any marks for it.
You must then (as a pair) also demonstrate your work to your
tutor during the first hour of the following week's lab.
<p>
<b>Summary</b>: to obtain any lab marks for the Week X lab, you <b>must</b> do 2 things:
<ul>
<li> <em> submit your lab work by the following Monday 11:00am </em>
<li> <em> demonstrate your work to your tutor in the week X lab class </em> <br>
OR <em> demonstrate your work at the start of the lab in week X+1</em>
</ul>
<p>
You cannot obtain marks by e-mailing lab work to tutors.
<p>
Lab exercises will be assessed using the following grade system:
<p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed  table-striped">
<tr> <th>Grade <th>Criteria </tr>
<tr> <td> A+ <td>Complete, correct, and clear solution - if there are challenge exercises a good attempt on these must be made
<tr> <td> A <td>Competent solution to standard lab exercises
<tr> <td> B <td>Most of standard lab exercises completed, to all completed but with one or more major bugs
<tr> <td> C <td>Partial solution only, most of lab not completed
<tr> <td> . <td>Not attempted
</table>
<p>
Challenge exercises may be specified for some labs.
<p>
There will be more lab marks available than necessary
to obtain full marks for the 10% lab component.
In other words total lab marks will be capped.
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindent">If you cannot complete the exercise by the end of the lab
  you may complete it in your own time and submit it using the give command <b> by Monday 11:00 in the week after the lab</b>.
  You can then demonstrate it your tutor in next week's lab and they will mark the submitted code. Only the submitted code can be assessed.
